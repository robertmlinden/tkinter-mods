## Spreadsheets Project

The goal of this WIP is to experiment with creating a programmer-friendly spreadsheet tool build from lightweight Tkinter widgets. Well-known spreadsheet tools like Excel, OpenOffice, etc. are quite useful to the average non-technical person, but for those of us who rely on macros and complicated scripting to save time and achieve our goals, these tools become less helpful.

The goal is to simplify macros by making Python the indigenous language (rather than VBA).

At best, I hope to mimic the most useful features of the current existing tools; plus what I have outlined above.
