## Spreadsheets Project

The goal of this WIP is to experiment with creating a programmer-friendly spreadsheet tool using Tkinter widgets. Tools like Excel, OpenOffice, etc. are quite useful to the average non-technical person, but for those of us who not only want but _need_ macros, the aformentioned tools are weak.

The goal is to simplify the process of creating macros for the user by making the indiginous language Python and providing a simple API library for such. Cell formulas will be Pythonic as an added bonus.

At best, I hope to take the best of every spreadsheet tool and add even more.
