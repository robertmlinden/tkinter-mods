## Spreadsheets Project

The goal of this WIP is to experiment with creating a programmer-friendly spreadsheet tool using Tkinter widgets. Tools like Excel, OpenOffice, etc. are quite useful to the average non-technical person, but for those of us who not only want but _need_ macros, Excel is a really crappy way to go.

Introducing...PySheets (name in progress), the way to create macros using your favorite language (Python) in a simple spreadsheet tool. Post an issue if you wish to suggest something that you wish that this tool would do.
